README

	Removing animals, and looking up animals are all part of the program.


Functionality
	
	"Add Animals" - Once the user has input what they want into the Java Gui,

	"Search for Animal" - User inputs the filter they would like, and press display.
	This will bring up a different interface dispalying all of the animals of that type
	or all the animals depending on what the user is looking for.
